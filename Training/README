Training the classifier using Hog Features.

Dataset: 5000 images

To generate the Hog Features, vl_hog() is used. The implementation for feature extraction can be seen at Training/Features/Hog_Features.m

For training libsvm is used. After Labelling the data as Positive/Negative Sample using tags, it is fed to the classifier. It generates the model which can be used later on for prediction.
